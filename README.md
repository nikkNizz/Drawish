### PRECOMPILED PACKAGES:
The compiled program for Linux and Windows can be downloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/nikkNizz/Drawish/releases) page of this project.  
Once the program is open you can create a quick link: from the [File -> Desktop shortcut] menu, a menu item is created in Linux or a desktop shortcut in Windows.

### COMPILE FROM SOURCE:
Download and unzip the project.  
Give the following commands from the terminal (instructions for Debian derivatives):

`sudo apt update`  
`sudo apt install g++`  
`sudo apt install cmake`  
`sudo apt install qt6-base-dev`  
`cd /path/to/Drawish_project`  
`cmake .`  
`make`  
*optional*  
`sudo make install` 

When there are changes, replace only the modified files with the newer ones and simply run the `make` command. The process will be very quick.

Or install and compile directly from **Qt Creator** on Windows, Mac, or Linux, without changing a single line of code!

#### USAGE
You can start drawing or you can open an image.  
Open images from the" File->Open" menu. You can also drag a file on the drawing area, 
paste an image from the clipboard ("Edit->Paste from clipboard") or from a file ("Edit->Paste from file").  
Some **settings**, such as pen size or text options, are automatically restored from the previous session.  

The drawing options are visible on the left of the drawing area.
The color palette is also visible here.
The first color on the top left is the active color (default black). Change the active color:  
-by clicking on a quick color or on the + button  
-from the "Image->Colors" menu and entering the rgb values ​​manually  
-using the pick color on the image.  
-From saved colors.  

When you select an option it will be active for the drawing area,
when you deselect it, it will no longer be active and any
pending operations will be deleted.

#### Command line
If you launch the program from the command line, you can also add the path of an image.  
 `/path/Drawish_xxxx.Appimage`  or  
 `/path/Drawish_xxxx.Appimage /path/to/image`  

For Italian users: you can run Drawish in English by adding the "en" parameter.   
 `/path/Drawish_xxxx.Appimage en`  or  
 `/path/Drawish_xxxx.Appimage /path/to/image en`  

#### Saving
Images are saved in png format.  
To save in jpg, ico, bmp, ppm, xbm or xpm format, choose the extension from the "format" box that appears.  
You can directly save the image to **PDF** from the "File->To PDF" menu. PDFs are saved in "<user>/Drawish_Data" or in home folder.  
For base64 format, see "Camera" chapter.  
You can set a **default folder** for the file picker: "Menu ->Default path for file picker".

#### Serialize
From the "Edit->Serialize" menu a window opens from which you can choose operations to perform on all the images contained in a folder.  
Choose the folder, check the operations of interest and enter any parameters.  
The **original images will not be overwritten** as a new folder will be created for the modified files.  
The operations will be performed in the order in which they are listed.

#### Undo/Redo
In the top left selection box you can navigate through the history of
the last 25 changes. You can also use the **ctrl-Z** key combination to go back.   
To return to the left image, press the top left button or **ctrl-R** [Redo].
